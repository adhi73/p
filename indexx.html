    <h1>Puvii thangoo</h1>

    <p>
      I don’t know how to begin this properly, so I’ll just be honest.
    </p>

    <p>
      I messed up. I know that. I know my actions and my words hurt you, and I won’t insult you by trying to justify them. You didn’t deserve that pain.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I want you to know is this — I see my mistakes clearly now. Not just that they were wrong, but <em>why</em> they were wrong. And that understanding has changed me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m choosing to become a better person, not out of fear of losing you, but out of love for what we have and what we could still be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our love and our life together mean too much to me to repeat the same mistakes. I’m turning over a new leaf — patiently, genuinely, and for the long run.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m not asking you to forget anything. I’m only asking you to see the effort, the growth, and the sincerity behind it.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter where we stand right now, my feelings for you are real, steady, and unchanged.
    </p>

    <p class="signature">
      Always,<br>
      Yours
